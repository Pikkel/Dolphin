# Dolphin
[![Rust](https://github.com/Pikkel/Dolphin/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Pikkel/Dolphin/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

~~Currently just a webhook spammer but I'll keep adding more~~<br>
~~No reason to keep this version private so I'm replacing the public one with this :^)<br>
I realized that I should focus on bigger and better projects and let shit like this rot<br>
I feel like this project is semi-decent quality so there's no reason to change it~~<br>
Thinking about maybe making improvements
